# Quick setup
This is a repository containing scripts for easily setting up my C# development environment.

## Installation
Run at your own risk. Run in multiple stages since some installations hijack the shell
### Stage One
```
sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasuvoss/fedora-setup/main/scripts/stage-one.sh)"
```
Restart before running stage two
### Stage Two
```
sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasuvoss/fedora-setup/main/scripts/stage-two.sh)"
```
